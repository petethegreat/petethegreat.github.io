## Thesis
I obtained my PhD in experimental high energy physics from the University of Toronto in 2013. Most of my work focused on the Forward Calorimeter of the ATLAS detector at CERN. A pdf version of my thesis can be found [here]({{ "/assets/petes_thesis_final.pdf" | relative_url }}), the source has been uploaded to [github](https://github.com/petethegreat/thesis).
